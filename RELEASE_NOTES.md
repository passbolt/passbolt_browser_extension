Passbolt v5.4.0 ships with encrypted metadata and the accompanying new resource types promoted to stable. These capabilities have been battle-tested for months, and the last remaining edge cases have been smoothed out so they can now be enabled for everyone.

Removing the beta label means that every new instance starts with encrypted metadata activated by default. As a result, features introduced in previous releases, such as icons, multiple URIs and custom fields, are available from day one without any action from end-users.

For existing instances, the activation process has been simplified: administrators can decide with a single click whether their organisation is ready or would prefer to postpone the launch. Once enabled, the instance immediately supports the new resource types and their extended capabilities. Because the change may disrupt external integrations, existing content is not migrated automatically; migration remains the responsibility of content owners or administrators. It can be performed item-by-item in the resource workspace or organisation-wide with the resource-metadata administration migration tool.

Revisiting resource capabilities was also an opportunity to increase the maximum size of secret notes to 50 000 characters, leaving ample room for full certificate chains, keys of any flavour or any long text you need to keep encrypted.

This release further improves cryptographic performance by introducing elliptic-curve keys (Curve25519/Ed25519) for new users. These keys provide security comparable to RSA-3072 while significantly reducing processing time and payload size.

Performance has been tuned for large organisations that manage substantial numbers of users or resources. Among other improvements: Users' workspace now opens more quickly, and deleting multiple resources generates fewer I/O operations.

Czech joins the list of supported languages, allowing native speakers to use Passbolt entirely in their own words, v√≠tejte!

Many thanks to everyone who reported issues and tested encrypted metadata over the past months. Your feedback made this release possible and brings these new features to all users today.
