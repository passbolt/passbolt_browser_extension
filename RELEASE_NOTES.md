Passbolt v5.3.2 is a security release designed to strengthen the security posture of your organization. It introduces a clipboard flushing feature, adds safeguards around SSO settings, and addresses issues related to encrypted metadata.

The new clipboard flush timer lets you copy secrets just long enough to use them; clipboard data is automatically cleared when the countdown (30s) expires, significantly reducing the risk of accidental exposure or leaks from forgotten clipboard content.

Additionally, SSO admin-settings edit endpoints of self-hosted instances can now be locked, reducing potential exposure to scans if an administrator account is compromised. You can verify if this protection is active, and get instructions on how to set it up, by running the health check via the server command line.

This update also resolves several encrypted metadata issues, moving the feature closer to general availability. Organizations can now enable encrypted metadata even if users have imported their own more complex keys (e.g. keys that were set to expire at some point), streamlining adoption for advanced users. Admin changes are smoother too: if the original metadata-enabling administrator leaves, newly invited users will still receive the metadata key automatically, removing the need for manual distribution. Lastly, users who owned shared resources using the new encrypted metadata format can now be deleted without issue, as ownership transfer is now handled correctly during the deletion process.

A big thank you to all testers who helped refine these features. If youâ€™re new to any of them, we welcome your feedback on the community forum or through your usual support channels!
