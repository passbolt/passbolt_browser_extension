            You should always make a backup. If you lose this key (by breaking or losing your computer
            and not having a backup for example), your encrypted data will be lost even if you remember
            your passphrase.

    <h3>Pro tips</h3>
    <p>
        The secret key is itself encrypted, so it is only usable if one knows the passphrase.<br><br>
        It is a good practice to store a backup in a different location.
        You can, for example, print it and mail it to a family member (along with a nice postcard!) and ask them to keep it somewhere safe.
        <br><br>
        Or, even better, you can store it in a safe if you have one!
